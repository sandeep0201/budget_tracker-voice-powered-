# Speechly Budget Tracker
In this projeect I've build a Complex Expense Budget Tracker. While building it, I got to learn many advanced React & JavaScript topics. Some of them are State Management in React, Context API, Local Storage, Material UI, and how to create a scalable React folder structure. But most importantly, I got to learn how to add voice capabilities to your applications using Speechly.
